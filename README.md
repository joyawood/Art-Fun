# Art-Fun

Side projects involving fractals, math, pretty things, and general fun. Currently working in d3.

## Circles
circles.html is a visual representation of times tables using modular arithmetic. It was inspired by *[this awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8)*.

Still: 2 multiplication table

![the 34 multiplication tables](https://github.com/joyawood/Art-Fun/blob/master/34.png?raw=true)
Still: 34 multiplication table

![the 101 multiplication tables](https://github.com/joyawood/Art-Fun/blob/master/101.png?raw=true)
Still: 101 multiplication table

## Modulus fun
dancingSquares.pde is a processing sketch made to introduce into Java students to generative art and modular arithmetic.
